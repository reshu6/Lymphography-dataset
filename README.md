# Lymphography-dataset
Title: Lymphography Domain.
Relevent Information: This is one of three domains provided by the Oncology institute.
that has rpeatedly appendred in the machine learing literature.
Number of Instatnces: 148
Number of instatnces: 19 including the class attribute.
Attrbute Information: all attribute values in the database have been entered as numeric  alues corresponding to their index in the list of attribute values for tht attributes domain as given below.

Missing attribute values: None
Class Distribution: 
Class, normal find, metastases, mailign lymph, fibrosis

To do this data we have to learn imbalance dataset.

Techinique we need to perform is
1. perfrom EDA
2. apply imblearn SMOTH algorith to balance the classes.
3. Creating the algorithm use tensorflow keras to create the neural network.
4. Tune the model using GridserchCV.
Plot accuacy a loss graphs.
 Test the model.
